				<p>
					Our founding team realized there was a gap in the ICT service sector in Uganda. They could see that
					there were many practitioners but were not customer focused and lacked dynamism in their services.
					The idea of GATA came about to fill in that space as many customers could not stand the shortcomings
					of ICT professionals who seemed not to meet their needs and also were not well versed with the
					demands of the market. We then decided to form GATA as a solution to this. Our brand is dedicated to
					ensuring that customers are adequately catered for whatever the ICT service soughed from us. Today
					we boost of being the fastest growing IT, Security systems and electrical engineering solu- tions
					services provider in Uganda and East African Region.
